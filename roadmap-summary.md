# Konta Roadmap Summary

This document lists the completed phases of the Konta development roadmap, providing a concise summary of accomplishments and verification status for each milestone.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security
* **Completion Date:** June 13, 2026
* **Objective:** Establish a secure, Clean Architecture foundation, set up encrypted local storage (SQLCipher + secure storage key management), and implement core presentation/domain utility classes.
* **Accomplishments:**
  - **Directory Structure:** Initialized clean architecture folders (`core`, `data`, `domain`, `presentation`).
  - **Native Setup:** Configured iOS `Podfile` (`use_frameworks!`) and Android `minSdkVersion` (21+) for compatibility with SQLCipher libs.
  - **Drift & SQLCipher:** Created `AppDatabase` utilizing SQLite / SQLCipher with automated key generation and hardware-backed storage via `SecureStorageManager` (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain).
  - **Core Utilities:**
    - Designed custom light and dark `ThemeData` featuring a deep navy blue brand identity and `ThemeExtension`-based financial colors (pastel green for income, pastel coral for expenses).
    - Structured the application's base custom exception hierarchy (`AppException`, `DatabaseException`, `ValidationException`, etc.).
    - Implemented `CurrencyFormatter` for robust formatting, compact representation, locale-specific parsing, and percentage formatting.
* **Verification:**
  - Standard static analysis pass (`flutter analyze` with 0 issues).
  - Integrated comprehensive unit tests (`test/unit/currency_formatter_test.dart`) showing 100% success rate under automated environments.
